            <li>Another option is to use Search Engine Optimization to get people to your site
            <li>Content marketing is very slow and takes a long time to see a payoff

            <li>If a gateway doesn’t support your currency except exchange fees
            <li>Figure out if you’re selling products one at a time or do you need recurring payments
            <li>If you only have a few products, you may not need a fully featured shopping cart, and an easy to set up solution like Gumroad may be a better use of your time
            <li>Checking out with Paypal
            <li>There are many ways to use paypal, like paypal express and paypal advanced

            <li>Checking out with Stripe
            <li>Stripe is one of the many payment gateways that can allow customers to pay with a credit card directly in your checkout
            <li>Any time you are accepting credit cards on your site, make sure you have an SSL Certificate
            <li>Shipping, Orders,and Taxes
            <li>Calculate shipping costs
            <li>There’s many ways to ship your products
            <li>Flat rate shipping, usually a per order or a per item cost
            <li>You can offer free shipping a certain price point, customers will spend a bit more to avoid shipping charges
            <li>Manage your orders
            <li>Wordpress provides a few roles for managing your site that limit Users to writing content, or just being able log in
            <li>Using stripe or woocommerce, you can be able to refund a partial or total amount
            <li>It’s a good idea to investigate how the refund process works on your platform
            <li>Manage your inventory and listings across platforms
            <li>Putting products on both big sites like amazon and your own website is best for both worlds
            <li>You have to manage the inventory and product data
            <li>There are many services that you have choose from to find the perfect solution for your website
            <li>You have to understand the taxes
            <li>Tax can come from State, City, Country
            <li>You usually collect one set of taxes
            <li>In Europe, they display tax-inclusive prices
            <li>In the US, they display tax-exclusive prices
            <li>Some states in the U.S. make certain types of food, clothing, medicine, or medical equipment tax exempt.
            <li>You'll have to consult with your tax professional to determine if any of your products meet that criteria. Before you launch your site, you should reach out to a tax professional
            <li>Collec EU value-added tax (VAT)
            <li>EU have additional tax when your customers are in EU
            <li>WooCommerce and Easy Digital Downloads integrate Taxamo to help users with confusing tax laws

            <li>Securing Your Site
            <li>Understanding the basics of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
            <li>You have to secure your page to ensure that your customers are safe from third parties from intercepting your customer's private information
            <li>You can use services like paypal to secure your customers’ purchases
            <li>You would need a SSL certificate to run HTTPS for secure websites
            <li>While accepting credit cards directly on your site is visually appealing, the commitment to PCI compliance is pretty demanding for a small business. It's much easier and safer to start with an off-site gateway.
            <li>Protect sensitive data
            <li>Even though you have SSL installed, you need to force your customers to use SSL and prevent them from using regular HTTP when they’re on a page with sensitive data
            <li>Processing even one transaction unsecurely could be devastating to your business.
            <li>Using WordPress for Ecommerce
            <li>Use native WordPress platforms
            <li>Try to use platforms build on top of WordPress
            <li>Wordpress will provide everything for you unless if you want to use amazon to process credit cards, then you’ll need to purchase the Amazon add-on
            <li>WooCommerce is good also, but updates are slow because they don’t want to break any pre-existing services
            <li>E commerce is incredibly complex and you need to make sure you're keeping your system up-to-date. In the last year, WooCommerce put out two dozen updates most of which are bug fixes.
            <li>This has a little to do with the quality of WooCommerce code and everything to do with the complexity of E Commerce.
            <li>Implement third-party platforms
            <li>It’s very easy to implement third-party platforms, but you won’t be able to edit them as you want
            <li>But some third-parties will take a higher transaction fee
            <li>You will little control over the product page
            <li>Some third-parties charge a monthly fee for the use of their services
            <li>Testing and Optimization
            <li>Test your site
            <li>Before you launch any website, you would want to test it first
            <li>Check the cart and checkout to make sure that it won’t cache too much
            <li>Make sure that the live shipping quotes are working correctly
            <li>Make sure you can get paid
            <li>Test gateways to check functionality to make sure you’re getting paid
            <li>Make sure discounts are adding up correctly
            <li>Test each service you’re connected to
            <li>Make sure to triple check everything on your site
            <li>Optimize your website
            <li>Install an analytic tool to make sure you know what’s happening on your website
            <li>Track your customers and see what they want from your website
            <li>Figure out if they get confused with your website
            <li>Optimizing your website can increase the amount that stay on your website and purchase products
            <li>After optimization make sure to test your tweaks
